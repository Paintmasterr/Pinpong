## Pinpong Game general information

-Before making this game, we normally tried it with pygame, but due to some bugs and we couldn't fix it, we had to use the Turtle library and we started the game production phase.



-While making the game, we first created the window, adjusted the color and size, and then adjusted the first views of the leaderboards.



-Then we created two players and added their commands, the B player was then enabled to work with artificial intelligence.



-Then we added the commands of the game ball and formed the basis of the game. Then we added a few codes that allow the ball to bounce angle and which side the ball hits, count the number and create the game.



-But at the end, there was a problem while closing the game. Canvas problem occurred. We finished the game by writing the canvas codes and a few codes that will solve the problem in the closing of this game in the while code, and now we have prepared for the presentation.
